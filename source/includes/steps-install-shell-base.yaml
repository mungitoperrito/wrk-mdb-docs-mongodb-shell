   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as
   part of the download or you extract the archive without the
   ``tar`` command, you may need to run the following command to
   make ``mongosh`` executable:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x /path/to/mongosh

   You can either:

   - Copy the ``mongosh`` binary into a directory listed in your ``PATH``
     variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin`` (Update
     ``/path/to/mongosh`` with your installation directory as
     appropriate)

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp /path/to/mongosh /usr/local/bin/

   - Create a symbolic link to the ``mongosh`` binary from a directory
     listed in your ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin``
     (Update ``/path/to/mongosh`` with your installation directory as
     appropriate):

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo ln -s  /path/to/mongosh /usr/local/bin/
...
