   Download the appropriate version of ``mongosh`` for your operating
   system. MongoDB also provides versions of ``mongosh`` that use the
   system's OpenSSL installation. For details, see the `MongoDB Download
   Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell?jmp=docs>`__.

   Extract the files from the downloaded archive. For example, run the
   following command from the directory containing the downloaded
   ``.tgz`` package:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongosh-{+version+}-linux-x64.tgz

   You will need to provide your exact ``.tgz`` package in the command,
   which may vary depending on the package version you downloaded. For
   example, the ``mongosh`` OpenSSL 3 package is:
      
   .. code-block:: sh
   
      mongosh-{+version+}-linux-x64-openssl3.tgz

   The extracted ``bin`` folder contains two binaries: ``mongosh`` and
   ``mongosh_csfle_v1.so``.
   
   For ``mongosh`` packages that support OpenSSL, you will see a
   different ``.so`` file. For example, ``mongosh_crypt_v1.so``.

   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as part of the
   download or you extract the archive without the ``tar`` command,
   you may need to make the binary executable. Run the following
   command from the directory where you extracted the archive:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x bin/mongosh

   You can either:

   - Copy the ``mongosh`` binary into a directory listed in your
     ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin``. Run the following
     commands from the directory where you extracted the download file:

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp mongosh /usr/local/bin/
       sudo cp mongosh_csfle_v1.so /usr/local/lib/

     For ``mongosh`` packages that support OpenSSL, you will see a
     different ``.so`` file. For example, ``mongosh_crypt_v1.so``. Use
     that file instead in the previous command.

   - Create symbolic links to the ``MongoDB Shell``. Switch to the
     directory where you extracted the files from the ``.tgz`` archive.
     Run the following command to create links to a directory already
     in your ``PATH`` such as ``/usr/local/bin``. 

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

...
