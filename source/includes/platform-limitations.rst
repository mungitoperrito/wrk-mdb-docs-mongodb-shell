  Enterprise Server (SLES) 12, and Ubuntu 18.04 support is deprecated
  and might be removed in a later ``mongosh`` release.
- If you must use ``Node.js`` 16 with ``mongosh``, install ``Node.js``
  and then install ``mongosh`` through ``npm``. The ability to run
  ``mongosh`` installed with ``npm`` and use ``Node.js`` 16 might be
  removed during the lifetime of ``mongosh`` 2.x.
