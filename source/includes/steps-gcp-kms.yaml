  Configuring client-side field level encryption for the GCP KMS
  requires your GCP Email and its associated Private Key.
  The AWS Access Key must correspond to an IAM user with all *List* and
  *Read* permissions for the KMS service.
  
  In ``mongosh``, create a new
  :ref:`ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions` variable for storing the
  client-side field level encryption configuration, which contains these
  credentials:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     var ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions = {
       "keyVaultNamespace" : "encryption.__dataKeys",
       "kmsProviders" : {
         "gcp" : {
           "email" : "YOUR_GCP_EMAIL",
           "privateKey" : "YOUR_GCP_PRIVATEKEY"
         }
       }
     }

  Fill in the values for ``YOUR_GCP_EMAIL`` and
  ``YOUR_GCP_PRIVATEKEY`` as appropriate.

  In ``mongosh``, use the :method:`Mongo()<Mongo()>` constructor to
  establish a database connection to the target cluster. Specify the
  :ref:`ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions` document as the second
  parameter to the :method:`Mongo()<Mongo()>` constructor to configure
  the connection for client-side field level encryption:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     csfleDatabaseConnection = Mongo(
       "mongodb://replaceMe.example.net:27017/?replicaSet=myMongoCluster",
       ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions
     )

  Replace the ``replaceMe.example.net`` :ref:`URI <mongodb-uri>` with
  the connection string for the target cluster.

ref: create-encryption-key

  Create the data encryption key using the
  :method:`createKey() <KeyVault.createKey()>` shell method:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     keyVault.createKey(
       "gcp",
       { projectId: "projectid",
         location: "locationname",
         keyRing: "keyringname",
         keyName: "keyname"
       }
     )

  Where:
  
  - ``projectid`` is the name of your GCP project, such as
    ``my-project``
  - ``locationname`` is the location of the KMS keyring, such as
    ``global``
  - ``keyringname`` is the name of the KMS keyring, such as
    ``my-keyring``
  - ``keyname`` is the name of your key.
