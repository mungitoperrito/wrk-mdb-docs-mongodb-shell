When working with a `MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`__
or MongoDB Atlas cluster, you can use ``mongosh`` to configure
:manual:`Client-Side Field Level Encryption
</core/security-client-side-encryption>` and connect with encryption
support. Client-side field level encryption uses data encryption keys
for supporting encryption and decryption of field values, and stores
this encryption key material in a Key Management Service (KMS).

``mongosh`` supports the following KMS providers for use with
client-side field level encryption:

- Amazon Web Services KMS
- Azure Key Vault
- Google Cloud Platform KMS
- Locally Managed Keyfile

Create a Data Encryption Key
----------------------------

The following procedure uses ``mongosh`` to create a data encryption key
for use with client-side field level encryption and decryption.

Use the tabs below to select the :abbr:`KMS (Key Management Service)`
appropriate for your deployment:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Amazon KMS
      :tabid: aws-kms

      .. include:: /includes/steps/aws-kms.rst

   .. tab:: Azure Key Vault
      :tabid: azure-vault
      
      .. include:: /includes/steps/azure-vault.rst

   .. tab:: Google Cloud KMS
      :tabid: gcp-kms

      .. include:: /includes/steps/gcp-kms.rst

   .. tab:: Local Keyfile
      :tabid: local-keyfile

      .. include:: /includes/steps/local-keyfile.rst
