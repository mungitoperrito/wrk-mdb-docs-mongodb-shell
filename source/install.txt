Prerequisites
-------------

To use the |mdb-shell|, you must have a MongoDB deployment to connect
to. 

- For a free cloud-hosted deployment, you can use
  `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.

- To learn how to run a local MongoDB deployment, see
  :manual:`Install MongoDB </installation/>`.

      Install with Homebrew
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. important::
 
         To view the complete list of system requirements for Homebrew,
         see the
         `Homebrew Website <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`__.

      The Homebrew package manager is the recommended installation
      method for ``mongosh`` on macOS. To learn how to manually install
      ``mongosh`` from an archive instead, see
      :ref:`macos-install-archive`.

      To install ``mongosh`` with Homebrew:

      Install from Tarball

      tarball:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-macos.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: linux

      Select the appropriate tab based on your Linux distribution and
      desired package from the tabs below:

      - To install the ``.deb`` package on Ubuntu and Debian,
        click the ``.deb`` tab.
      
      - To install the ``.rpm`` package on
        :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)`, click the
        ``.rpm`` tab.

      - To install the ``.tgz`` tarball, click the ``.tgz`` tab.

      .. tabs::
      
         .. tab:: .deb
            :tabid: deb

            .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-linux-deb.rst
