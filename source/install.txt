To use the |mdb-shell|, you must have a MongoDB deployment to connect
to.

         To view the complete list of system requirements for Homebrew,
         see the
         `Homebrew Website <https://docs.brew.sh/Installation>`__.

      The Homebrew package manager is the recommended installation
      method for ``mongosh`` on macOS. To learn how to manually install
      ``mongosh`` from an archive instead, see
      :ref:`macos-install-archive`.

      To install ``mongosh`` with Homebrew:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-macos-homebrew.rst

      .. _macos-install-archive:

      Install from Tarball
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To manually install ``mongosh`` using a downloaded ``.tgz``
      tarball:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-macos.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: linux
      
      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-shell-generic-linux.rst

Next Steps
